# Mod Jam Response  
**By Amanda Stormyr**  

Here are my reflections on three Mod Jam projects from class from Arielle Wong, Jordan Lobasso and Chloé Guérin.

Wow, there’s so much to explore in this game, and so many details and parameters, even though it sticks to the frog-eating-flies format. It becomes a completely new experience where the frog isn’t just catching flies but looking for a balanced, healthy life. The added challenges like solving math puzzles and chatting with the frog make it feel alive and interactive, and every round feels a little different.  

The mods you made are hilarious, with old age, meditation, depression, back pain, and those quotes from old people like “Did you know that my neighbour bought new types of trash bags? Wonder if it’s the divorce making them crazy.” It actually made me laugh out loud. They feel personal, like things you’ve overheard your family members saying.  

Your use of variables to control new states like aging and mood adds a lot of depth to the original game logic. I love how the frog’s appearance changes with age, the wrinkles and colour shifts give a clear sense of time passing. It’s a really smart use of visual feedback tied to the code.

I do wonder about the choice to leave out audio. Maybe it was intentional, or just a time constraint, but adding sound could really build the atmosphere. There’s so much potential here for sound design, like the frog meditating with soft breathing or a relaxing hum.  

You might also think about adjusting the pacing. The life meter decreases quite fast, which makes it hard to read the funny quotes and explore all the features. It might still feel urgent and stressful if slowed just a bit, but it would give players time to enjoy everything.  

Your code is organized and easy to follow, and conceptually it’s full of personality. This mod shows both humor and care, and I can’t wait to see what you do next.

What really gets me here is the sound design and overall concept. The start menu with the church bell, cat meow, spooky organ, and then the screams, “argh,” and gulp sounds is genius. It’s so chaotic that it becomes funny in a great way. The story of having “sinned” because of the 10 frogments adds another hilarious layer.  

I love how you used sound triggers with each interaction. It feels like every event has a reaction. It makes the gameplay loop feel alive.

Visually, I really like the instruction screen, but the text blends in a bit. You could try adjusting the text color so it’s easier to read. The centered and left-aligned text mix gives it an odd rhythm, which is kind of fun, but a little contrast or a slight font tweak could help the text stand out while keeping your frog-hell vibe.  

The use of memes and GIFs is really effective. You build suspense before the game even starts, which is such a strong design choice.  

I could imagine a custom score or timer display that fits your theme better, something chaotic, slimy, or apocalyptic, to tie the story together. Your code is neat and readable, and your attention to audio and timing shows great understanding of how sound can drive interaction.  



## Chloé Guérin – “FrogFrogFrog”

This game feels really sweet and peaceful. The sound design is calming, and you’ve created a cozy, slow atmosphere with minimal elements. You could add more sounds to deepen it, like buzzing flies or soft slurp sounds when the tongue overlaps. Or even something absurd, like flies coughing or the frog talking to itself. Those little surprises could make it feel more personal and fun.  

Your background setup with the tree and the little pond straw is really soothing. You could consider drawing the background in Illustrator and importing it as an image if you want to save some time, since you’ve drawn all your elements as code directly in VS Code. It’s a lovely setting, but that might help speed up the process for future projects.  

Right now the game is very easy. I would say almost impossible to lose, which is interesting. You could lean into that even more and make it a meditation game where you simply exist in the frog’s world.  

From a code point of view, adding movement along the y-axis for the flies would make their paths more dynamic, and a reset function would let players loop the game without reloading. Both would make the experience smoother.  

The start and end screens look great with the leaf design and custom font, clean and consistent.
