## Description

**Fun Part I: Einstein's Treat Frenzy** is a continuation of my previous game Doggy Doggy!
At the end of that game, the player answered “yes” to the question “You wanna do something fun?”
This is the first fun activity, helping good-boy Einstein get as many treats as possible. (Yum yum.)

Einstein catches the tossed dog treats with his long pink tongue while his absolute favorite song, “Good Morning” by Debbie Reynolds, Donald O’Connor, and Gene Kelly, plays in the background.
When the song ends, the fun’s over because he’s had enough treats.

The fun can’t last forever... or can it?
Play again!

### Controls

- Click to start
Use your mouse to move Einstein’s tongue and click again to catch as many treats as you can before time runs out.
