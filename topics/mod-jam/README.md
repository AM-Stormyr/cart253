### Context  
This project is the sequel to my previous game [*Doggy Doggy!*](https://am-stormyr.github.io/cart253/topics/self-portrait), which is the prequel.  
In *Doggy Doggy!* the player meets me and Einstein for the first time.  
After the player answers “yes” to “You wanna do something fun?”, this game begins, the first fun activity in the series.

### Description  
*Fun Part I: Einstein’s Treat Frenzy* is a continuation of my previous game *Doggy Doggy!*  
Einstein catches tossed dog treats with his long pink tongue while his absolute favorite song, *“Good Morning”* by Debbie Reynolds, Donald O’Connor, and Gene Kelly, plays in the background.  
When the song ends, the fun’s over because he’s had enough treats.  

The fun can’t last forever... or can it?  
Play again!  

### Based on  
This project is a modification of [Pippin Barr’s](https://pippinbarr.github.io/cart253/) original game **frogfrogfrog**.  

### Modifications
- Start screen with a clickable treat (bone) that begins the game
- Ending triggered by the end of the song (with record scratch cue)
- Simple score counter and timer display
- Dynamic difficulty: treats fall faster as time passes
- Custom visuals and theme (Einstein + treats)
- Full audio design: soundtrack, eating sounds, and random "you want a treat?" and “good boy” voice clips
- Restart option after game over

### Controls
- Click to start
- Use your mouse to move Einstein’s tongue  
- click again to catch as many treats as you can before time runs out.
