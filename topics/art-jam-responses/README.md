## Arielle Wong – Ari and the Soup

Hi Arielle,  
Your self-portrait is very cute and fun. It’s such a simple idea with the glasses steaming up, but it gives me a real sense of what it’s like being you. I imagine you love a hot bowl of soup, curled up on the couch with a blanket, orange and red leaves outside your window, about to watch your favorite show, but your glasses keep fogging up from the steam.

Your avatar is also super cute. It’s simple but really effective in how you added the bangs on one side. That little detail breaks the symmetry and gives the character so much life, so it doesn’t just feel like mirrored shapes.
The color palette is warm and soft, which gives me that cozy feeling right away. Having the soup bowl in blue works really nicely too, because it pops against all the warm tones and immediately draws my eye to it.

The clicking sound effect for the bowl works great. It makes me, as a player, feel like I’ve picked something up and put it back down. I would just suggest lowering the volume a bit, because since there are no other sounds, it is very loud if someone has their volume high (especially on headphones).

The outline that appears when hovering over the soup is also a nice touch. It tells me there’s something to interact with. 

The steam effect on the glasses works really well too. It’s smooth and reads clearly once you notice it. I might just make the steam appear a little faster. To be honest, I only discovered it after reading your README, which might just be me, but because nothing else changes right away when moving the mouse, I didn’t realize something was happening at first.
Maybe you could add one or two more small sounds. For example, if there was a soft “Mmm, yummy” sound when the soup is near the face, it would make it feel like the avatar is reacting.
You could also add a bit of ambient sound to set the mood, like a crackling fire or a TV show playing quietly in the background. That would help make the “click” sound less harsh and give a fuller sense of the environment. It’s a simple but powerful way to suggest a lot without adding visuals, using sound as part of the setting for your self-portrait.

You did such a great job. It really feels like I got to know a bit more about you through this piece.
